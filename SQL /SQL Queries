- Problem: Choose specific countries and life expectantcy for comparision

select * from country
where 
Continent = 'Asia' and LifeExpectancy < 50
or Continent = 'Africa' and LifeExpectancy < 70;


- Gathering specific subset of columns

select Name, Continent, SurfaceArea from country;


- Comparing cities in europe by GNP

select name, code, continent, GNP as Gross_National_Product
from country
where continent = 'Europe'

Additionally:

select * 
 from ( 
select name, code,continent, GNP as Gross_National_Product
from country
) as x
where continent = 'Europe';


- Make Categorical Variables based upon the average LifeExpectancy 
select avg(LifeExpectancy) from country;

select name, Continent, LifeExpectancy,
    case when LifeExpectancy < 56 then 'High Mortality'
        when LifeExpectancy > 76 then 'Low Mortality'
        when LifeExpectancy >= 56 and 
            LifeExpectancy <= 76 then 'Normalish'
        end as Mortality
from country;


- Gather the rows will null values in Life Expectancy

select *
 from country
where LifeExpectancy is null;


-substitute the values of null in population to 0

select name, coalesce(population, 0) as population
from country;

- Gather data with a specified pattern for example
countries whose independance day begin with 19__ or having a population of 100_000

select name, continent, population , Indepyear
from country
where continent = 'North America' 
and (indepyear like '%19%' or population > 100000);

- Sort gathered elements be specified continent and ordered by yeah of independence in descending order
select name, continent, population, indepyear
from country
where Continent = 'Africa'
order by IndepYear desc;
